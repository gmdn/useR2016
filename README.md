# useR2016
In this repository, we show the examples of usage of the package Shiny for text retrieval, classification and quantification, discussed in the abstract submitted to useR! 2016.

## Text Retrieval
The [interactive text retrieval](https://gmdn.shinyapps.io/shinyRF04/) demo allows students (and researchers) to get deeper insight into the consequences of probabilistic modeling assumptions (Binary Independence Model vs BM25) and the consequences of tuning parameter values by means of a two-dimensional representation of probabilities.

## Text Classification
The [interactive text classification](https://gmdn.shinyapps.io/shinyK/) demo it is possibile to study the problem of Na√Øve Bayes text classification on a two dimensional space and use this graphical interpretation to analyse different approaches to find the best decision on for different distribution assumptions (Bernoulli, Multinomial, and Poisson).

## Text Quantification
